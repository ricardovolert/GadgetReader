/** \namespace GadgetReader
 *  Class for reading Gadget files*/

/** \mainpage 
 * \section intro_sec Introduction 
 * GadgetReader (librgad.so) is a small library with one single class 
 * for easily reading Gadget-1 and 2 formatted files. 
 * \section feat_sec Features
 * Somewhat higher level than the readgadget.c that comes with Gadget-II, GadgetReader has 
 * been written because I noticed that I was maintaining several long, fragile and 
 * immensely tedious files called things like "read_snapshot.c" whose sole purpose was to deal 
 * with multiple files, check header consistency, work out how much memory to allocate, etc, etc.
 *
 * GadgetReader attempts to do all these things automatically with an easy programmatic interface. 
 *
 * It aims to support Gadget-I and endian swapping simply and as robustly as possible. 
 *
 * It attempts to detect a few trivial programmer errors, or file corruptions. 
 *
 * The original readgadget.c has to seek through the *whole* file to find every single block. 
 * On an NFS mounted filesystem, this can be prohibitively slow. GadgetReader builds a map of the 
 * block locations once, in the class constructor, and further reads involve only a single seek. 
 *
 * Finally, it includes an example program, a test suite, and bindings for both python and perl. 
 *
 * \section usage_sec Usage
 * To use GadgetReader in your C++ program, simply do:
 *
 * using namespace GadgetReader;
 *
 * GSnap snap("some_snapshot");
 *
 * snap.GetBlocks("POS ",data_array, snap.GetNpart(BARYON_TYPE), 0, 0);
 *
 * This will get you the positions of all baryons in the snapshot.
 *
 * A longer example is contained within PGIIhead.cpp; this program is also useful for printing Gadget file headers. 
 *
 * \section details_sec Details
 * 
 * There are a few gotchas to use of this library. 
 *
 * The largest one concerns the final argument of GetBlocks , called skip_types. 
 * In order to support getting one type of particle at a time, we need to know which particles
 * correspond to which particle types. This would be easy if all blocks contained data for all particles,
 * however this is not the case; an internal energy block, for example, will only contain data for gas particles
 * (which may be any subset of types 0 and 2-5). Therefore we provide the skip_types argument;
 * this is a bitfield which instructs GadgetReader to skip particle types which are present in the block, 
 * but which are not desired.
 *
 * If the header shows that there are no particles of a given type in this snapshot file, skip_types for this
 * type has no effect.
 *
 * Do not attempt to read multiple non-contiguous types at once, this is not yet supported.
 *
 * Some examples:
 * For a POS block containing Baryons, DM and stars, to get only the DM, use:
 *
 * skip_types = 2**BARYON_TYPE+ 2**STARS_TYPE, or 2**N_TYPE-1 -2**DM_TYPE
 *
 * For a U block containing Baryons and stars, to get only the stars, use:
 *
 * skip_types = 2**BARYON_TYPE or 2**N_TYPE -1 -2**STARS_TYPE - 2**DM_TYPE 
 *
 * Note the DM_TYPE is not skipped, as it does not appear in the file.
 *
 * Gadget-I format files do not contain block names. GadgetReader attempts to detect the default block order, but
 * this will not work if you are using a modified GADGET. Therefore, in this case, you should pass a vector of 
 * std:strings containing the ordered names of the blocks to the constructor. You can then load the particle blocks
 * as normal using GetBlocks()
 *
 * There is no metadata containing the number of bytes used per particle in a given block. 
 * GadgetReader attempts to guess this, however, should the guess be incorrect, you can override it with 
 * the SetPartLen() method.
 *
 * \section req_sec Requirements
 * A C++ compiler with map, vector, set and stdint.h
 *
 * getopt for the example program
 *
 * Boost::Test library >= 1.34 for the test suite
 *
 * Swig > 1.30 for the bindings
